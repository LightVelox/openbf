# While the maintainer is playing (a `game` process outside the capped run-*.scope units),
# jobs take ci.lock exclusively: one at a time, as before. Otherwise a job holds ci.lock
# shared plus one of HEAVY_SLOTS slot locks, so up to HEAVY_SLOTS jobs run at once.
# Old-style `flock ci.lock ...` callers still work: they wait for every shared holder.
# A job already running when play starts keeps running (it is niced and CPU-weighted).
#
# Env: HEAVY_SLOTS (3), HEAVY_TIMEOUT seconds (3600), HEAVY_MEM (16G), HEAVY_LOCKS (lock dir).
# HEAVY_WARM=1 (and no CARGO_TARGET_DIR set): build in a persistent per-slot target,
# ~/.cache/openbf-warm/slot<N>, so a new worktree reuses compiled dependencies instead of
# building from scratch. Not for builds whose binary is run from engine/target (the game).
