//! Phase B: what every AI unit is FOR — the PS2's Conquest goal
//! (`analysis/re-conquest-goal.md`, audited PARTLY 2026-10-02 - its banner and
//! section 10; its section 8 is this module's build list). One [`TeamPlan`] per team holds each unit's target —
//! attack that post, hold this one, or go hunt — and `core::ai`'s follower
//! obeys it instead of Phase A's "walk at the nearest post that is not mine".
//!
//! The PS2 has NO team planner. Each bot draws ONE post that is not its
//! team's, at random by the post's authored value, and keeps it; nothing in
//! the draw looks at distance, enemies or crowding (doc sections 2, 3, 6).
//! [`draw_post`] is that draw; [`plan`] is the goal's 1 s tick, which draws
//! only for a unit that has no target or whose target is done:
//!
//! | a unit draws when | BF2 | BF1 |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | it has no target (a new life) | yes | yes |
//! | its target is its own team's | when `value_def` is 0 | at once (and when an own target is lost) |
//! | 5 s inside an own target's capture region | yes | yes, excluding that post |
//! | no route to the target | yes | PORT GUARD |
//! | a post lost to neutral | — | up to five units within 60 m retake it |
//!
//! OURS, each PROVISIONAL:
//!
//! - the 5 s clock restarts when the unit leaves the region or has a fight
//!   target: the PS2's capturers stay until an order interrupts the capture
//!   order and leave 5 s after it resumes, and the port's fight is not an
//!   order (doc section 8, item 2c);
//! - "the team can spawn at it" is read as "the team owns it";
//! - [`Objective::Hunt`] when a unit can route to no post that is left to
//!   take, and instead
//!   of holding a post once a side is down to its last reinforcements
//!   ([`crate::ai::HOLD_ENDGAME`]) — the port's endgame (card STEND); the PS2
//!   draws an own post there;
//! - the reachability drop on a BF1 map (BF1's draw has none), and the
//!   [`DWELL_GIVE_UP`] report, which re-draws without the post given up on;
//! - card DEFS, a NAMED DEVIATION (the maintainer, INBOX 2026-10-12: the PS2's
//!   capturers all hold the post, and the port's all stood on its one Cover
//!   hint): a post keeps at most a quarter of the team's living units as
//!   defenders, the nearest ([`DEFEND_SHARE`]); one once it has been quiet
//!   for 5 s and none after 20 s ([`defend_cap`], [`post_threatened`]); a
//!   defender over the cap draws again at once; and an authored hint is ONE
//!   defender's ([`TeamPlan::spots`], [`pick_spot`]);
//! - a vehicle's ban flags are not ported; the PS2's driver-shares-its-draw
//!   rule is: a passenger takes its AI driver's target.
//!
//! Properties that are not negotiable, because the replay spine rests on them:
//!
//! - it is SIM STATE, hashed with everything else ([`crate::sim::Sim::hash`]);
//! - it runs at a fixed cadence — team `t` plans when `tick` reaches its
//!   `next_plan_tick`, staggered so the two teams never plan on the same tick;
//! - teams in index order, units in index order, posts in index order, and the
//!   only randomness is a per-unit HASH ([`crate::ai::route_rand`]'s shape) —
//!   never the shared LCG, which `think` may not touch either.
