//! A building turret takes the ordnance's damage (playtest 2026-10-28, BF2
//! Kamino: "turrets don't lose their health", a rocket at a turret left its
//! gunner alive). `analysis/re-turret-collision.md` [O]: a round or blast
//! that meets the armed building damages the building only (3.1), through
//! the ordnance's scale for its HealthType (building, B1 FUN_001c08b0); its
//! blast measures the building past its own bodies (3.4); at 0 every turret
//! seat's gunner is killed with the building's last hit (4.1, 4.2). Before the
//! fix the building's bodies were plain map bodies: a round stopped on them
//! as on a wall (`Hit::World`) and the pool never fell.
//!
//! Each case is a real map's turret class with a bot of the other side in its
//! seat, shot from 15 m by a human of the real shooting class with the real
//! weapon: the turret's drop is the round's direct damage at its age plus its
//! blast's on the building's sphere, by the ordnance's building scales; then,
//! at 1 health, the next round destroys it and kills the gunner (a kill for
//! the shooter); the building's bodies are a plain wall after.
