//! The flight hum of an ordnance in the air (card WHUM; `re-weapon-sounds.md`
//! 0.5, 5.2-5.4): one looping voice per live round whose class authors
//! `OrdnanceSound`, moved with the round and pitched by the PS2's doppler.
//!
//! The PS2 asks the hum on a handle the ordnance owns when the ordnance is
//! made and again on every update until a voice starts (a start at level 0 is
//! refused, and a looping sound is retried); the update moves the handle with
//! the ordnance's position and velocity and the handle is stopped when the
//! ordnance's life runs out or it is destroyed (B1 `FUN_002728a8` 195215,
//! `FUN_00272e98` 195357-195370, B2 `FUN_0030eef8` 301500, `FUN_0030f988`
//! 301815-301827). Every round with the key hums - an infantry bolt's `_sm`
//! as much as a rocket's: the PS2 starts one `com_weap_inf_ord_hum_sm` with
//! every blaster shot at the player (`re-weapon-sounds.md` 5.3,
//! `analysis/audio-census.md`).
//!
//! Render-only: this reads `sim.bolts` and the class table and never writes
//! the sim (the caller's loop voice is `crate::sounds`' handle, card WHUM's
//! note from VSND).
//!
//! PROVISIONAL, named here rather than hidden:
//! - the voice count is capped at [`HUM_VOICES`] and, over it, the rounds
//!   nearest the listener keep their voice. The PS2 keeps 78 one-shot voices
//!   and steals the lowest level x priority (card WSND); that pool is not
//!   ported, so this cap is the port's own;
//! - each start's `PitchDev` (0.15 on the hum properties) is not drawn: the
//!   mixer path ([`crate::sounds::SoundLib`]'s loop voices) takes the
//!   property's pitch and the doppler alone;
//! - the doppler's inputs are the last tick's round and the listener's own
//!   velocity (`Soldier::vel`), as the PS2's `d1` reads the listener's
//!   velocity too. The doc marks the term's units and a missing clamp near 0
//!   [H] (`re-weapon-sounds.md` 12); the mixer's 0.1 rate floor is all the
//!   clamp there is.
