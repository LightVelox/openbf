/// order the bake emits them. Chunking the GLB silently breaks that: the
/// vertex count stops being `n²` (chunk seams duplicate a row), and on BF1
/// Hoth 69,169 happens to be a perfect square, so the guard in `heightfield`
/// passes and the sim gets a garbage ground plane — soldiers and the camera
/// end up floored against nonsense, and `--sim-hash` moves. Splitting here
/// leaves the baked data, the manifest and every sim path untouched by
/// construction.
///
/// Falls back to the unsplit mesh whenever the terrain is not the grid this
/// assumes (which is the same contract `Scene::heightfield` checks).
